Thanks for wanting to hack on atc!
You probably want to see the introduction, copyright, and environment
sections. Formatting is touched on a bit in the introduction, but might
be worth reading anyways.

4. Formatting

To begin working on atc, you'll need to make sure you have the fairly
obvious tools: C compiler, text editor, autoconf, automake, make.
That's all you'll need to start. clang-format is also very useful; if
you don't clang-format your code, it might take longer to be accepted.

Once you make a change, you will need to contribute it. You can do this
by emailing a patch to <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>, or by sending a
GitHub pull request. For the patch, all you need is diff(1); for the
PR, you will indeed need Git and a GitHub account.

When you're making your changes, keep track of them in the ChangeLog
file. This follows the normal GNU changelog format; see the GNU Coding
Standards [0]. At the end, your changelog entry should sum up what
happens in your commit/patch. If you have a larger change with multiple
commits that are semantically different, send them as separate
patches/commits and separate changelog entries.

Document the copyright ownership of a file at the top, and mention that
it is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0.
to contact you. Claim copyright on a file once you've made non-trivial
changes; this is mostly your discretion, but you can refer to the GNU
Maintainer Information [1] if you're really not sure. Your notice should
look like:

    // (c) 2021 John Doe
    // This file is part of the atc project.
    // Licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 only.

Note that I currently don't want copyright papers, and that the last
two lines shouldn't be included if they're already there. Replace the
comment indicator with whatever's appropriate (e.g. dnl, #). Multiline
comments are OK. Avoid other licenses, except for documentation. In
that case, use the GFDL or Creative Commons licenses; ask the
maintainer as to what to use.

Remember to include your email address in the ChangeLog, and remember to
update it if it changes; if the copyright ever needs to be reassigned or
the license updated, it'll be important to contact you quickly. (You
should still leave it even if you don't claim copyright, so someone can
contact you if they have questions.)

=== ENVIRONMENT ===
If you have the distributed tarball and don't need to edit the
Makefile.am or configure.ac files, then you can just ./configure and
use Make normally.

Otherwise, you'll need autoconf and automake. Run
`autoreconf --install' to create all the files they need, and then you
can ./configure as normal. Automake should automatically reconfigure
when you change ./configure.

To build, just run make. The executable will be in `atc'.

=== FORMATTING ===
C files should be formatted with clang-format. Don't make any
formatting changes: even if it looks better, it's not easy to
replicate. (You can try tweaking the config.) They should have about
80 columns maximum.

Text files should be wrapped at 72 characters, and be UTF-8.

Manpages should have three comment lines between sections, and one
between subsections.

License files should not be modified from their canonical version.
