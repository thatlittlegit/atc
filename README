atc is a small, simple program to wait until the end of a second
before exiting. It might be useful for aligning clocks, such that you
only have to say, "execute every second" instead of doing it yourself.

To install from a tarball, you can do the standard GNU autoconf
'./configure && make && make install' procedure. If you're installing
from the Git repository, you'll need to run `autoreconf --install'
first to generate the necessary files.
