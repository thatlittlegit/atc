        * ChangeLog: Create this changelog! Now this is meta.

2021-01-10  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        * atc.c: Put logic for getting nanosecond time and sleeping n
        nanoseconds into their own functions. These functions are ifdef'd
        to call the best libc function for the job.
        * atc.c: Set clock_gettime/nanosleep as default functions with no
        config.h.
        * configure.ac: Add detection for clock_gettime, gettimeofday,
        nanosleep, and usleep.

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        * configure.ac: Add a --with-getopt option to choose which
        argument parser to use. If 'yes' or unset, uses the first it can
        find.

        * atc.c: Create the --version text inline

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        * atc.c: Move unknown-option logic to the end of getopt_impl.
        If an option is in optstring but the handler is missing, we behave
        a bit better.

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        * atc.c: Put brackets around 'unknown' in default PACKAGE_VERSION

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        * atc.c: Define HAVE_UNISTD_H and HAVE_GETOPT if we're on UNIX
        without config.h.

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        Transition to Automake as the build system. The main reason I did
        this is so then we could follow most of the 'standard' GNU
        guidelines for Makefiles, like `make dist', without any hassle.

        * Makefile.in: Removed, now generated by automake.
        * Makefile: Add include for Makefile.common.
        This makes it easier if you don't know which command to run.
        * Makefile.common: Added a small stub task `autoreconf' that runs
        autoreconf.
        * Makefile.am: New super-short automake input file.
        * README: Add a readme to clarify installation options.
        * configure.ac: Enable automake.

2021-01-08  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        * configure.ac: Require clock_gettime properly by erroring if it
        isn't defined.

2021-01-08  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        Add getopt_long support. This flexes autoconf a bit more than
        before, where it was a glorified `cp Makefile.in Makefile'.

        * atc.c: Ensure that some headers are only included if we have
        them.
        * atc.c: List long-forms of command line options in the help text.
        * atc.c: Add a getopt_impl ifdef for getopt_long.
        * configure.ac: Check for getopt_long and define HAVE_GETOPT_LONG
        if it exists.

2021-01-07  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
        Add initial revision of atc. I managed to write main() in about
        five minutes! Yay!

        * atc.c: Add initial code in a roughly-GNU style.
        * .clang-format: Basic WebKit-like style; I don't like the GNU
        brace format.
        * .editorconfig: Initial, boring "use utf-8" template.
        * Makefile.in: Add basic makefile to build atc.c
        * configure.ac: Add basic autoconf configure script to check for
        clock_gettime. This will be iterated on later.
