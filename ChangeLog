	* Makefile.am: Add a symlink to atc named second_align.
	* atc.1: Mention the new synonym.

	This avoids the conflict with atc(6) in bsdgames.

2020-01-11  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* configure.ac: Fix double brackets in my email address.

2020-01-11  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	Change the ChangeLog over to tabs. VIM highlights all of the spaces,
	and tabs are cool.

	* ChangeLog: Convert all leading spaces to tabs.
	* .editorconfig (ChangeLog): Specify tabs in the ChangeLog instead of
	spaces.

	The editorconfig was falling out of date.

	* .editorconfig (Makefile.am): Correct outdated Makefile.in rule to
	apply to Automake files instead.
	* .editorconfig (ChangeLog): Clarify to use eight spaces.

2020-01-11  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	There's no need for the Makefile stub, as it was not documented
	anywhere and complicates the git repo. It also dies in a
	maintainer-clean.

	The solution is to type `autoreconf --install' instead of
	`make'; it doesn't give the false illusion that you can avoid
	autoconf. Autoconf will always find (and haunt) you.

	* Makefile.am: Remove include of Makefile.common
	* Makefile.common: Remove entirely.
	* Makefile: Remove Makefile.common stub.

2020-01-11  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* HACKING: Add contributing guide.

2021-01-11  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* atc.1: Add a manual page.
	* Makefile.am: Install the manual page automatically.

2021-01-10  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* ChangeLog: Create this changelog! Now this is meta.

2021-01-10  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* atc.c: Put logic for getting nanosecond time and sleeping n
	nanoseconds into their own functions. These functions are ifdef'd
	to call the best libc function for the job.
	* atc.c: Set clock_gettime/nanosleep as default functions with no
	config.h.
	* configure.ac: Add detection for clock_gettime, gettimeofday,
	nanosleep, and usleep.

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* configure.ac: Add a --with-getopt option to choose which
	argument parser to use. If 'yes' or unset, uses the first it can
	find.

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* atc.c: Create the --version text inline

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* atc.c: Move unknown-option logic to the end of getopt_impl.
	If an option is in optstring but the handler is missing, we behave
	a bit better.

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* atc.c: Put brackets around 'unknown' in default PACKAGE_VERSION

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* atc.c: Define HAVE_UNISTD_H and HAVE_GETOPT if we're on UNIX
	without config.h.

2021-01-09  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	Transition to Automake as the build system. The main reason I did
	this is so then we could follow most of the 'standard' GNU
	guidelines for Makefiles, like `make dist', without any hassle.

	* Makefile.in: Removed, now generated by automake.
	* Makefile: Add include for Makefile.common.
	This makes it easier if you don't know which command to run.
	* Makefile.common: Added a small stub task `autoreconf' that runs
	autoreconf.
	* Makefile.am: New super-short automake input file.
	* README: Add a readme to clarify installation options.
	* configure.ac: Enable automake.

2021-01-08  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	* configure.ac: Require clock_gettime properly by erroring if it
	isn't defined.

2021-01-08  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	Add getopt_long support. This flexes autoconf a bit more than
	before, where it was a glorified `cp Makefile.in Makefile'.

	* atc.c: Ensure that some headers are only included if we have
	them.
	* atc.c: List long-forms of command line options in the help text.
	* atc.c: Add a getopt_impl ifdef for getopt_long.
	* configure.ac: Check for getopt_long and define HAVE_GETOPT_LONG
	if it exists.

2021-01-07  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>
	Add initial revision of atc. I managed to write main() in about
	five minutes! Yay!

	* atc.c: Add initial code in a roughly-GNU style.
	* .clang-format: Basic WebKit-like style; I don't like the GNU
	brace format.
	* .editorconfig: Initial, boring "use utf-8" template.
	* Makefile.in: Add basic makefile to build atc.c
	* configure.ac: Add basic autoconf configure script to check for
	clock_gettime. This will be iterated on later.
